* Should we allow accessing the default underlying and default value directly through the API?
* Should there be a (convenience) method for creating a value with a given underlying, in the context of a DataHolder?
* Should it be easily possbile to go from a BaseValue to an ImmutableValue/Value without casting?
* Should ChangeDataHolderEvent deal with only values, or manipulators too?
* Should DataTransactionResult use a Map for each of 'successful, rejected, and replaced' data?
* What form should the event filters take?
* Should DataTransactionResult be a ValueContainer/something else, or expose three views into iteslf that implement ValueContainer/something else?
