     * instead of the item dropped, it will return a non-empty optional. If the custom
     * entity is provided, it will be spawned in the place of the item stack entity, and
     * the related {@link EntityItem} is then removed from the world and spawn list.
     *
     * @param world The world to spawn the entity
     * @param location The location to spawn the entity
     * @param itemstack The item stack to be used for the entity (should be the same item type of this item)
     * @return The custom entity item instead of the original entity to be created
